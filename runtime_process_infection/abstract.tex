Injecting arbitrary executable code into a process is the end goal of exploitation.
Many techniques already exist for injecting code. This paper will describe existing
techniques as well as a novel new technique. The new technique provides stealthy
injection into anonymous memory maps. The reader will need to be well-versed in ELF,
Linux memory management on 32bit Intel systems, and the C programming language.
Basic knowledge of assembly on 32bit Intel systems is assumed. Though the paper
describes 32bit systems, a reference tool has been implemented that works on
both 32bit and 64bit Linux systems.
