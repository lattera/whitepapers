Writing malware on Windows is a relatively easy task. The win32 API is very friendly
towards malware authors. Microsoft even provides a library called detours which makes
injecting DLLs into a process during runtime extremely easy. Detours, however, does
not provide stealth. Linux has a similar project called injectso. Injectso is a
non-stealthy solution for injecting shared objects into a process during runtime.
